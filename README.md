# Poker Simulator

## Getting started

The latest build is live at https://poker.lamsaoquenem.day/

### Building locally

I use `Svelte Kit` to build this. You can build and run the application with

```
npm run dev
```

Then open this `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser

## Backend

Heavy computation is done in `rust` and compile back to `wasm`
Detail on the implementation will be explained [here](https://github.com/hucancode/poker-solver)
