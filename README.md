# Poker Simulator

## Getting started

The latest build is live at https://poker.lamsaoquenem.day/

### Building locally

I use `Svelte Kit` to build this. You can build and run the application with

```
npm run start
```

Optionally you can run tests with

```
npm test
```

Then open this `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser

## Motivation

This tool will help you approximate your winning chance in a [Texas Holdem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) poker game.
Kindly set a board, click `Compute`, and let the computer do the hard work for you.

Without a doubt, luck plays a significant role here,
but stepping into the game without a good mathematical foundation is equivalent to doing charity.
I hope my codes can do a little help preparing you on that aspect â˜º.

## Methodology

### Hand evaluation

I use some [bit math](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)>) to match given hand of cards to a set of precomputed patterns. Then rank the hand accordingly.
Kindly check `src/lib/poker/special-hands.js` for pattern building algorithm.
Kindly check `src/lib/poker/compare.js` for hands comparing/ranking algorithm.

### Combinations

Since the total combinations are so big, traversing every possibility is not realistic (especially when my [programming language](https://www.javascript.com/) is not very fast). I use [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_algorithm) method to get the approximate result. Here is how many outcomes may happen in any round

|                   | Flop (2 hidden cards) | Turn (1 hidden card) | River (All cards visible) |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Possible Outcomes | 1070190               | 45540                | 990                       |
